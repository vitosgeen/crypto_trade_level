The system trades both SHORT and LONG.
A base level acts as the central reversal point.
Three tier levels on each side trigger scaled entries (1×, 2×, 3×).

If price approaches base from below:

Touch tier → open SHORT.

Not reaching base & reversing → keep SHORT (in profit).

Reaches base → close SHORT.

Goes down afterward → open SHORT again.

Goes up → open LONG.

If price approaches base from above (mirror logic):

Touch tier → open LONG.

Not reaching base & reversing → keep LONG (in profit).

Reaches base → close LONG.

Goes up afterward → open LONG again.

Goes down → open SHORT.

This repeats infinitely:
SHORT below base — LONG above base — close on base crossings — open new ladder on reversals.
